Section to prove claim 0:																												Dani
(1) Plot Gurfil vs Ward0 vs Wardw; GTO IC; a(t), e(t), %i(t)
	identical when:
		(a) when there is no atmospheric drag
		(b) when there are no numerical issues
	different because:
		(a) approximations of integral

Section to prove claim 1:																												Dani
(0) Discuss where we get Ariane 5 data
(1) Plot Gurfil vs Wardw vs NonAve vs Ariane 5; Ariane 5 IC; a(t), e(t), i(t)
	different because:
		(a) Drag is a function of relative velocity. Without atmospheric rotation, we just have absolute velocity.
(2) Plot Gurfil vs Wardw; prograde and retrograde orbits IC; a_pro(t), a_ret(t)

Section to prove claim 2:																												Sandeep
(1) Plot Wardw terms; Ariane 4; rho(\beta a e), I0(\beta a e), I1(\beta a e) , and I2(\beta a e)

Big takeaway: Both averaged implementations of the two models are insufficient by itself												Dani/Sandeep
Claim 0: Ward and Gurfil are identical when atmospheric rotation in Ward is set to zero.
Claim 1: Gurfil is insufficient because atmospheric rotation delays reentry for prograde orbits
Claim 2: Ward is insufficient because the formulation is analytically ill-conditioned i.e. takes a product of a very small number with a very large number

Future work/Nice to have if we have time:																								Dani/Sandeep
Compare LEO vs GTO
Compare prograde vs retrograde orbits
Numerically tractactable Gurfil integral approximations with Ward's atmospheric rotation term

Known Facts:

Discuss the shortcomings of each model (Gurfil vs Ward)
	-> Gurfil: Show any plot where Gurfil over predicts loss of altitude because of neglecting atmospheric rotation
	-> Ward:
	
The simulated trajectories for the non-averaged equations should be oscillatory about the trajectories from the averaged equations.
Simulating the non-averaged equations is more computationally expensive.
