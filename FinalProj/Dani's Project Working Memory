Write it assuming we're not going to compare to real data
Set up a meeting with Rosengren and Black ASAP

[ ] Write section on sim results with J2 and luni-solar perts
	Say we are comparing Ward and Wang to the non-averaged as reference, and as expected, the results with the rotating atmosphere is closer tot he non-averaged.
[ ] Add section on h_p, h_a for Ward with varying AMR with all perts
[ ] If it doesn't look good, just use drag
[ ] Write conclusions section


h_p plot
Higher AMR has more damping; less overshoot, undershoot;

Assume mass is constant, area is changing
